**SPTAOReplacer**

This is a total replacement of Tarkov's built in AO. Tarkov uses an AO method caled "HBAO" or horizon based ambient occlusion. This replacer uses "GTAO" or ground truth ambient occlusion. GTAO is a more modern and accurate method of calculating ambient occlusion.

There isn't any configuration on this currently and I don't really plan on adding any. I'd rather not have people use this mod to crank the values to ridiculous levels and then share ugly screenshots... If you want to change the values, the project is open source, everything is in AmplifyGTAO.cs.

**NOTE: Colored Ultra AO currently does the same as just Ultra in this mod since this GTAO doesn't have an equivalent**

To install, simply copy the contents of the "SPTAOReplacer" folder into your SPT directory.
