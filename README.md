**AO Replacer**

This is a total replacement of Tarkov's built in AO. Tarkov uses an AO method caled "HBAO" or horizon based ambient occlusion. This replacer uses "GTAO" or ground truth ambient occlusion. GTAO is a more modern and accurate method of calculating ambient occlusion.

There isn't any configuration on this currently, possibly in the future. It just takes over the AO settings in graphics settings of Tarkov.

**NOTE: Colored Ultra AO currently does the same as just Ultra in this mod since this GTAO doesn't have an equivalent**

To install, just copy the contents of the "AOReplacer" folder into your SPT directory.

This is compatible with Hollywood FX/Graphics but the ambient occlusion settings in that mod will be ignored in favor of this one. Hollywood Graphics uses the built in AO, this replaces that AO. Double ambient occlusion is bad so I want to avoid that happening.
